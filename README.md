simreaderlib
============

python3 (3.2) module for easy interaction with "phoenix-type" card readers

Based on pySIM by Todd Whiteman.

Under development

Issues:

- CHV1 inconsistency in usage
- Some functions from extras.py work only with new 3G cards.
- Parts of code might be more ported from python2 better
- No tests :(
